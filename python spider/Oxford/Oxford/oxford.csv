Using historical records on the universe of inventors, and research laboratories, matched to decennial census records between 1850 and 1940, we find that as inventions start becoming more complex (combining more technologies) and innovative (using increasingly newer technologies), they reflect qualitative shifts in how individuals, teams and geography produce knowledge that persist until today."

Is AI bad for democracy? Analyzing AI’s impact on epistemic agency,,17:30 - 19:00,,"Cases such as Cambridge Analytica or the use of AI by the Chinese government suggest that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) creates some risks for democracy.

It then suggests some implications for research and policy.

And how will the prospect of governing algorithmic systems with natural language prompts affect long-standing debates in machine ethics?

Elisa Palagi: Income inequality and climate change,,14:30,,"Climate anomalies, such as floods and droughts, as well as gradual temperature changes have been shown to adversely affect economies and societies. Although studies find that climate change might increase global inequality by widening disparities across countries, its effects on within-country income distribution have been little investigated, as has the role of rainfall anomalies. We show that extreme levels of precipitation exacerbate within-country income inequality. The strength and direction of the effect depends on the agricultural intensity of an economy. In high-agricultural-intensity countries, climate anomalies that negatively impact the agricultural sector lower incomes at the bottom end of the distribution and generate greater income inequality.

Nanditha Mathew: Positioning firms along the capabilities ladder,,14:30,,"We develop and apply a novel methodology for quantifying the capability development of firms, and putting these capabilities (and hence also the firms) in a hierarchy, that we refer to as their position on the capabilities ladder. Our nestedness algorithm, inspired by biology and network science, defines a capability as complex if it is performed by only a few firms at the upper rungs of the ladder. We analyze balance sheet and innovation data of almost 40,000 Indian firms for the time period 1988-2015, and observe significant nestedness. Lower rungs of the capabilities ladder correspond to basic managerial and production capabilities. Mid-level rungs correspond to internationalization and acquiring absorptive capacity. Higher level rungs are more related to M&A and innovation. ICT capabilities have become more fundamental lower-level rungs on the capabilities ladder in recent years. We find that capability ranking can explain future growth patterns and survival probability of firms, summing up in one number their future potential trajectories.
